Predicting the probability of customer churn for a telecommunications company
A learning task for predicting the probability of customer churn for a telecommunications company. An analysis of the data was carried out, during which a portrait of a "typical user" of the company's services was created, conclusions were drawn regarding the use and refusal to use certain services. A linear classification model and a gradient boosting model have been built, and the required quality metric has been achieved.
